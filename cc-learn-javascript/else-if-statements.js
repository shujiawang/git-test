// Let’s create a program that keeps track of the way the environment changes with the seasons. Write a conditional statement to make this happen!
// In main.js there is already an if...else statement in place. Let’s add an else if statement that checks if season is equal to 'winter'.
// Inside the code block of the else if statement, add a console.log() that prints the string 'It\'s winter! Everything is covered in snow.'.

// Add another else if statement that checks if season is equal to 'fall'.
// Inside the code block of the else if statement you just created, add a console.log() that prints the string 'It\'s fall! Leaves are falling!'.

// Add a final else if statement that checks if season is equal to 'summer'.
// Inside the code block of the else if statement you just created, add a console.log() that prints the string 'It\'s sunny and warm because it\'s summer!'.



let season = 'summer';

if (season === 'spring') {
    console.log('It\'s spring! The trees are budding!');
} else if (season === 'winter') {
    console.log('It\'s winter! Everything is covered in snow.');
} else if (season === 'fall') {
    console.log('It\'s fall! Leaves are falling!');
} else if (season === 'summer') {
    console.log('It\'s sunny and warm because it\'s summer!');
} else {
    console.log('Invalid season.');
