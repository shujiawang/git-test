/*
In main.js there are two variables mood and tirednessLevel.

Let’s create an if...else statement that checks if mood is 'sleepy' and tirednessLevel is greater than 8.

If both conditions evaluate to true, then console.log() the string 'time to sleep'. Otherwise, we should console.log() 'not bed time yet'.

After you press “Run”, play around with the || operator and the ! operator! What happens if you negate the value of the entire statement with ! and switch to || instead of &&?
